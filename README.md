A beginner-friendly Python project: Number Guessing Game using random module. User guesses the number with feedback like "Too High" or "Too Low." Tracks number of attempts. Helps understand loops, conditionals, and input handling. Ideal for Python practice.
# 🎯 Number Guessing Game - Python Project

A simple command-line game built using Python, where the computer randomly selects a number and the player tries to guess it with hints provided.

## 🚀 Features
- Random number generation using Python's `random` module  
- User input and interactive prompts  
- Feedback on each guess: "Too high" or "Too low"  
- Tracks number of attempts  
- Victory message when the correct number is guessed  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python (Core Concepts)
  - `random.randint()`
  - `while` loops
  - `input()`, `print()`
  - Conditional statements
## 💡 How It Works

1. The computer randomly picks a number between 1 and 100.
2. The player is prompted to guess the number.
3. Based on the guess, the program gives feedback:
   - “Too high!” if the guess is higher than the actual number.
   - “Too low!” if the guess is lower than the actual number.
4. Game continues until the correct number is guessed.
5. Finally, total number of attempts is displayed.
